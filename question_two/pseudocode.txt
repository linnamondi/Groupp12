Input
List of jobs, each with ordered tasks and processing times
Workers with unique skills and availability schedules
Machines with capabilities, availability, and planned maintenance windows
Job priorities and due dates
Output:
Optimized schedule assigning tasks to workers and machines
Start and end times for each task, respecting availability and maintenance
Maximized job throughput and minimized total completion time
Pseudocode:
Initialize timeline calendars for workers and machines including maintenance periods.
Prioritize jobs based on due dates, processing times, and priority levels.
For each job task, identify eligible workers and machines matching required skills and capabilities.
Find earliest available time slots for both worker and machine, avoiding maintenance and conflicts.
Assign task to matched worker and machine at earliest feasible time.
Update calendars to mark assigned slots as occupied.
Repeat task assignment until all jobs are fully scheduled.
Apply heuristics (e.g., shortest processing time first) to optimize resource utilization and reduce idle time.
Continuously monitor and adjust schedule to accommodate maintenance and unexpected delays.
Output final schedule maximizing throughput and minimizing makespan while respecting all constraints.
